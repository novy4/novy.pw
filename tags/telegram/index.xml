      <description>Introduction Once upon a time I had a need to for a telegram bot that will reposts news from external channels to my own channel to stay up-to-day with news from different sources in one place. Doing some short research, I didnâ€™t found suitable open-source script for my needs and I decided to write my own script on python. It is not ideal, but it works :-)
There is a library called Telethon  that makes easy to write python applications that can interact with Telegram.</description>
