      <description>Introduction Once upon a time I had a need to for a telegram bot that will reposts news from external channels to my own channel to stay up-to-day with news from different sources in one place. Doing some short research, I didn’t found suitable open-source script for my needs and I decided to write my own script on python. It is not ideal, but it works :-)
There is a library called Telethon  that makes easy to write python applications that can interact with Telegram.</description>

      <description>Azure provides disk encryption option for Iaas virtual machines, this is a perfect solution for those who want to keep data encrypted with own keys. Some aspects I would like to clarify here to have a more transparent solution. I have tested and implemented this solution. Ok, lets have some fun&amp;hellip;
There are some prerequests before we can start to encrypt our disks.  Azure Disk Encryption is only supported on specific Azure Gallery based Linux server distributions and versions.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
